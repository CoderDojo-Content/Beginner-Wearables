1. These Sushi Cards will introduce you to Wearable Electronics. These are electronic circuits made using components (parts) especially designed to be sewn directly into clothes or accessories. 
<!-- note about cost/group size etc here or just on the kata page? i.e. are we hiding this info from the kids who are using the cards, this intro page is part of the printout, do I make another "intro intro" page that doesn't get printed, etc -->
2. You will get to learn about and make electronic circuits and also do some sewing.
3. I am going to make a felt badge or patch that lights up

4. The badge is designed so that lots of them can joined be together to make a glowing patchwork. -- MAYBE CHANGING THIS --
  - ADD AS AN ADDITIONAL CARD? (maybe the "Create a switch" concept...)
5. You can use this kind of technology to decorate clothes, bags, hats... The possibilities are unlimited!
