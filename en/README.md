1. These cards are going to introduce you to Wearable Electronics. You're going to get the chance to:
 * learn about electronic circuits
 * build a circuit using components especially designed to be sewn directly into clothes or accessories
 * make a felt badge that lights up
 * You'll end up with something that looks like this (though you can play around with colours and adding images to brighten it up if you like!).

2. You can make lots of these badges and join them together to make a glowing patchwork!


3. Once you've learned these techniques, you can apply them to create more than just a quiz! These same coding tools can be used to make a complete interactive story, or to build a calculator, or a whole bunch of other cool apps.

- what we're going to make
- examples of the cool stuff you can do with them (?)
