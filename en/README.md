1. These Sushi Cards will introduce you to Wearable Electronics. These are electronic circuits made using components (parts) especially designed to be sewn directly into clothes or accessories. 
2. You will get to learn about and make electronic circuits and also do some sewing.
3. I am going to make a felt badge or patch that lights up

4. The badge is designed so that lots of them can joined be together to make a glowing patchwork. -- MAYBE CHANGING THIS --
5. You can use this kind of technology to decorate clothes, bags, hats... The possibilities are unlimited!

<!--
Conductive thread can be used in circuits because it is made with metal that electricity can flow through. The best part is that it's also thread that you can sew. This means you can build a circuit right into a piece of fabric (for example, clothing) without any hard wires or cables - all you need is a sewing needle and a pair of scissors!
