1. You can also extend your badge circuit so that separate pieces of felt with their own LEDs can be joined onto it to make them light up!

2. First you will need another badge. This one will not have a battery of its own. But without a battery, where will the threads go?

3. When you sew your LED onto this new badge, do the running stitches all the way to the edge of the felt, or near the edge.
 * The positive and negative threads should still be kept separate from each other!

4. Then sew several medium sized stitches next to each other or in a criss-cross. You want to make it look like a "blob" of conductive thread on the felt. Finish the stitches as normal, by doing 3 tiny stitches in one spot before cutting the thread short.

5. Once you have one blob for the negative, and one blob for the positive, the new badge is ready. Now you just need to extend the circuit on the main badge (the one with the battery).

6. Decide where you want to the badges to join together. Mark two spots on the first badge where the positive and negative "blobs" touch it. You will be sewing matching blobs here for them to connect to. You can put the new badge to one side for the next bit.

7. Taking new thread, sew a bunch of stitches at the spot you marked for the *negative* blob.
 
8. Then sew a *running stitch* all the way to the LED on this badge and secure it to the *negative* hole.
 
9. Repeat steps 7. and 8. to make a *positive* blob that is connected to the *positive* hole of the same LED.
 
10. When you are done it should look something like this:![](/assets/badge_extension_front_back_120_650.png)
