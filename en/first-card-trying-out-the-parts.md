1. Let's create your first circuit! Take a regular LED (one with two pins rather than a sewable one) and connect it to a battery by holding both pins to the battery, one on either side. Notice that one of the pins of the LED is longer than the other one. The longer one should be connected to the side of the battery marked with a plus sign '+'. Watch your LED light up!
 * Did it work? If not, check that that the pins are the right way round. ![](/assets/led_battery_140_291_650.png) 
 * Try flipping the battery over so the pins are connected the wrong way around, with the shorter one on the '+' side of the battery. Does it still work?
 
2. In every circuit there is a *positive*, '+' and a *negative*, '-' direction. For electricity to flow you need to match up the '+' ends and match up the '-' ends of your components. This is why the LED doesn't light up when you flip the battery around.

4. On the LED, the longer pin is '+' and the shorter pin is '-'. You can also identify '-' by looking closely at the bulb: it is the side with the flat edge.
 * A sewable LED is built onto a tiny *printed circuit board* so it has holes instead of pins. The holes are marked with '+' and '-' signs. ![](/assets/LEDs_pos_neg_100_650.png)

5. Separate the LED and the battery and pop the battery into a battery holder, with the + facing up (the holder will have a mark to show you the + side too). Team up with the person next to you and get two pieces of conductive thread.

6. Put one end of the first thread through the '+' hole of the battery holder, making sure it touches the metal, and hold the other end to the *positive* pin of the LED. You can use tape if you need to, although this will fray the thread a lot. If you have crocodile clips you can use these instead of thread. ![](/assets/circuit_thread_pos_100_191_650.png) 

7. Now take the second thread. Put one end through the '-' hole of the battery holder and hold the other end to the *negative* pin of the LED. ![](/assets/circuit_thread_complete_150_199_650.png) 

8. Make sure the two threads are not touching or crossing over at any point. If they do this will cause a *short* in your circuit and it will not work properly.
 * When you have a *short circuit*, the electricity tries to go the wrong way through the circuit and that's why it stops working.
   
9. Now you have a circuit and are ready to make a light-up badge!
