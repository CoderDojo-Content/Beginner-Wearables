1. Get LED and battery
2. "connect" them by holding both pins to the battery, one on either side
   1. What happens when you try it one way around and then the other? Why do both ways not work?
   2. Look at the battery, find the +. This is called *positive*. Has to match up with the *positive* on the LED - longer pin, non-flat side, marked '+' on sewable LED
   3. the other side is *negative*, '-' . Flat side of LED, shorter pin, or marked with '-' if using sewable LED. *negative* side of battery must be connected to *negative* on LED
