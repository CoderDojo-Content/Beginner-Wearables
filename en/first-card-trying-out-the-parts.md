1. Let's create our first circuit!
2. Take an LED and connect it to a battery by holding both pins, called *leads* to the battery, one on either side. Notice that one of the leads of the LED is longer than the other one. The longer one should be connected to the side of the battery marked with a plus sign '+'. Watch your LED light up!

 * Try flipping the battery over. Does it still work?
 
3. In every circuit there is a *positive* and a *negative* direction. For electricity to flow you need to match up the *positive* ends and match up the *negative* ends of your components. This is why the LED doesn't light up when you flip the battery around.
 
4. On the battery, the side with the plus sign '+' is the *positive* end. The other side is *negative*, which we write with a minus sign '-'.

5. On the LED, the longer lead is *positive* or '+' and the shorter lead is *negative* or '-'. You can also identify '+' and '-' on an LED by looking closely at the bulb: the side with the flat edge is *negative*.
 * A sewable LED is built onto a tiny *printed circuit board* so it has holes instead of pins. The holes are marked with '+' and '-' signs.

6. Separate the LED and the battery and get two pieces of conductive thread and some tape (if you have crocodile clips you can use these instead).

7. Tape one end of the first thread to the *positive* side of the battery (the side with the '+') and tape the other end to the *positive* lead of the LED.

8. Now take the second thread. Tape one end to the *negative* side of the battery and the other end to the *negative* lead of the LED.

9. Make sure the two threads are not touching or crossing over at any point. If they do this will cause a *short* in your circuit and it will not work properly.

10. Now we have a circuit that we can use to make a light-up badge!
