1. Let's create our first circuit!
2. Get LED and battery and "connect" them by holding both pins to the battery, one on either side
   1. What happens when you try it one way around and then the other? Why do both ways not work?
   2. Look at the battery, find the +. This is called *positive*. Has to match up with the *positive* on the LED - longer pin, non-flat side, marked '+' on sewable LED
   3. the other side is *negative*, '-' . Flat side of LED, shorter pin, or marked with '-' if using sewable LED. *negative* side of battery must be connected to *negative* on LED

3. Add conductive thread to the equation --- or leave this to the switches topic? other ways to connect - crocodile clips? 
--> crocodile clips if available, otherwise conductive thread and tape :)

note about being careful about shorting the circuit with your fingers etc



4. Complete a circuit by everybody holding hands! (is this actually a good idea... encouraging kids to let electricity flow through them... but it's so cool... maybe a lesson - this teaches us that electricity can flow through humans & if it's stronger than this little battery that's BAD) * THIS DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK ON THESE CIRCUITS :( *

<!-- TODO: PICTURES!! --> 


<!-- 

if no crocodile clips, use the thread - team up with the person beside you (unless you have four hands!)
