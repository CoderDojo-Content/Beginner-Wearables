1. Let's create our first circuit!
2. Take an LED and connect it to a battery by holding both pins, called *leads* to the battery, one on either side. Notice that one of the leads of the LED is longer than the other one. The longer one should be connected to the side of the battery marked with a plus sign '+'. Watch your LED light up!

 * Try flipping the battery over. Does it still work?
 
3. In every circuit there is a *positive* and a *negative* direction. For electricity to flow you need to match up the *positive* ends and match up the *negative* ends of your components. This is why the LED doesn't light up when you flip the battery around.
 
4. On the battery, the side with the plus sign '+' is the *positive* end. The other side is *negative*, which we write with a minus sign '-'.

5. On the LED, the longer lead is *positive* or '+' and the shorter lead is *negative* or '-'. You can also identify '+' and '-' on an LED by looking closely at the bulb: the side with the flat edge is *negative*.
 * A sewable LED is built onto a tiny *printed circuit board* so it has holes instead of pins. The holes are marked with '+' and '-' signs.

6. Add conductive thread to the equation --- or leave this to the switches topic? other ways to connect - crocodile clips? 
--> crocodile clips if available, otherwise conductive thread and tape :) or use use the thread without tape - team up with the person beside you (unless you have four hands!)

note about being careful about shorting the circuit with your fingers etc



4. Complete a circuit by everybody holding hands! (is this actually a good idea... encouraging kids to let electricity flow through them... but it's so cool... maybe a lesson - this teaches us that electricity can flow through humans & if it's stronger than this little battery that's BAD) * THIS DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK ON THESE CIRCUITS :( *
