1. By now you have needle and thread coming out of the felt where the LED has been attached. Imagine a line between this spot and the spot you marked for the - of the battery holder. If it helps, you could draw the line on the felt. You will sew a *running stitch* along this line to connect the LED to the battery holder. 

2. Place the tip of the needle on the line about one finger-space away from where the thread is coming out of the felt, and push it through, pulling the needle and thread all the way through as before.

3. On the other side of the felt, repeat step 2. Keep doing this until you reach the spot you marked for the *negative* hole of the battery holder.

4. Next, put your battery holder into place on the felt.

5. Just like you did for the LED, attach the battery holder by sewing five stitches through the *negative* hole. Remember to make sure they are good and tight!

6. To finish, sew about three tiny stitches right next to where you attached the battery holder, all the same place. This will secure the end of the thread to stop your work unravelling.

7. Cut the thread so that only a tiny bit is hanging out of the felt. 

8. You now have half of your circuit sewn. To complete the circuit, you need to connect the *positive* hole on the LED with the *positive* hole on the battery holder. Use the same method you already used to connect the *negatives*:
 * I am not including a switch in this circuit, but you could if you wanted.
 * Secure the LED with 5 stitches through the *positive* hole
 * Sew a *running stitch* all the way to one *positive* hole of the battery holder. **Important!** Make sure the path for your *positive* thread **does not cross or touch** the *negative* thread anywhere. Remember, this would cause a *short circuit* (a bad thing)!
 * Sew 5 stitches through the *positive* hole of the battery holder
 * Secure the thread with 3 tiny stitches all in the same place before cutting it short.
 
9. Congratulations! You have sewn a complete wearable circuit! Insert a battery into the battery holder, with the + facing up (the holder will have a mark to show you the + side too) and watch your LED light up :D

10. If you like, you could sew on an extra piece of felt to cover the battery holder using some ordinary embroidery thread or any plain thread. You can also decorate your badge with different coloured felt or thread. You design your own fashion!
