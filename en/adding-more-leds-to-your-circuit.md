1. Adding more LEDs to a circuit is easy! You don't need any additional batteries. You will connect the LEDs in *parallel*. There are two ways to do this.
2. One option is to create a whole new "loop" in your circuit for each LED that you want to add. In other words, repeat the process you followed to attach the first LED to the battery holder. You can connect additional LEDs to the same holes you already used on the battery holder, or to the other two holes. Here is an example of a separate loop using the other two holes. I haven't sewn the circuit onto anything, so you can see the threads clearly.![](/assets/more_leds_separate_120_333_650.png)
 * This gives each LED its own separate circuit with the same battery
 * You have to make sure all the threads are kept separate and don't cross over or touch, just like before.
3. Another option is to **extend** your existing circuit. With this method, you carry on the thread from both ends of the first LED and connect it to the matching ends of the next LED. 
 * You still must keep the positive and negative threads separate from each other!

 In the below example, I have used the same two long pieces of thread for both LEDs. You could also use two new pieces of thread, connecting the new LED to the first one just like you would connect it to a battery.![](/assets/more_leds_extended_120_225_650.png)
 * This method is great for saving thread, and also keeps the circuit simpler than the one in step 2 as you have less threads to keep separated from each other.
 
4. I am going to extend my badge circuit with one LED, and then extend it further so that LEDs on separate pieces of felt can be joined onto it!
