TODO

[ The "you're finished your project" has to come before this probably... does it make sense to have a whole extra card afterwards though? ]

- show how to make circuit with more than one LED (parallel/train track model)

- picture or diagram showing example of alternative badge design allowing many separate badges to be joined together to a single battery on the one circuit (same parallel setup)
