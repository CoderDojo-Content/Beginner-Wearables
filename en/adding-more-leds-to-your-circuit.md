[ The "you're finished your project" has to come before this probably... does it make sense to have a whole extra card afterwards though? ]

- show how to make circuit with more than one LED (parallel/train track model)

- picture or diagram showing example of alternative badge design allowing many separate badges to be joined together to a single battery on the one circuit (same parallel setup)


1. Adding more LEDs to a circuit is easy! The best way to connect them is in *parallel*. This is where each LED is connected to the battery by thread. You can do this in two ways.
2. One option is to create a whole new "loop" in your circuit for each LED that you want to add. In other words, repeat the process you followed to attach one LED to the battery holder on your badge, using the same battery holder. You can connect additional LEDs to the same holes you already used on the battery holder, or to the other two holes.![](/assets/tiny_stitches_triple_80_650.png)
 * This gives each LED its own separate circuit with the same battery
 * You have to make sure all the threads are kept separate and don't cross over or touch, just like before.
3. If you want to place the LEDs close to one another, for example in a line, then another option is to **extend** your existing circuit. [TODO: DESCRIBE]![](/assets/tiny_stitches_triple_80_650.png)


 * This method is also great for saving thread, and keeps the circuit simpler as you have less threads to keep separated from each other.
 
4. I am going to extend my badge circuit with one LED, and then extend it further so that LEDs on separate pieces of felt can be joined onto it!
