1. The different parts of an electronic circuit are called *components*. Here is a list of the components we'll be using:
 * A battery

 * LEDs

 * Sewable battery holder. This is a battery holder that's attached to a special board (called a *printed circuit board* or *PCB*) that you can sew onto your project

 * Conductive thread. This is like embroidery thread but it contains metal so that electricity can flow through it. We say that it *conducts* electricity.
1. conductive thread
2. LED - normal LED or sewable LED
3. Battery
4. Optional - switch - diff types available \(slide, push, etc\)
5. Coin cell holder \(battery compartment\) - some come with an integrated switch
6. fabric - something to attach your electronics to - e.g. clothing, felt \(OR use pins i.e. make badges?\)
<!-- TODO: INSERT PICTURES OF ALL OF THESE! -->

1. Expected cost â‚¬50 - should be enough for dojo of 25 children



say what the final project is
each card - how does this relate to the end product i.e. the project
