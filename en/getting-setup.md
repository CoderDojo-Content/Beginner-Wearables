 * A switch. You will see there are lots of different kinds of switches.
 * Some fabric to sew the components onto. This could be a piece of clothing or a bag or anything you like. We will be using regular craft felt.
 * Sewing needle, e.g. embroidery needle
 * Regular embroidery thread (or any kind of thread) (optional)
 * Scissors
 * Round-nosed pliers (required for sewing regular LEDs)
 * Tape
