1. The different parts of an electronic circuit are called *components*. Here is a list of the components you'll be using:
 * A battery ![](/assets/batteries_100_202_650.png) 
 
 * LEDs - these could be regular LEDs or sewable ones ![](/assets/LEDs_mix_150_272_650.png)
 
 * Sewable battery holder. This is a battery holder that's attached to a special board (called a *printed circuit board* or *PCB*) that you can sew onto your project ![](/assets/battery_holders_150_196_650.png)
 
 * Conductive thread. This is like embroidery thread but it contains metal so that electricity can flow through it. We say that it *conducts* electricity. ![](/assets/thread_150_268_650.png)
 * Crocodile clips (optional) ![](/assets/crocs_300_328_650.png)
 * A switch. You will see there are lots of different kinds of switches.
 * Some fabric to sew the components onto. This could be a piece of clothing or a bag or anything you like. I will use regular craft felt.
 * Sewing needle, e.g. embroidery needle
 * Regular embroidery thread (or any kind of thread) (optional)
 * Scissors
 * Round-nosed pliers (required for sewing regular LEDs)
 * Tape
 * Safety pin or any kind of badge pin
 
 Conductive thread can be used in circuits because it is made with metal that electricity can flow through. The best part is that it's also thread that you can sew. This means you can build a circuit right into a piece of fabric (for example, clothing) without any hard wires or cables - all you need is a sewing needle and a pair of scissors!
