1. What if you want to turn your circuit off? To do this you need a break somewhere in the connections. A _switch_ is a component that allows you to turn a circuit off and on easily.

2. There are lots of different types of switches - buttons, sliders, even magnetic or tilting ones. You can also make your own switch.

3. On your circuit, untape the thread from the _positive_ side of the battery. Take a new piece of thread and tape one end onto the battery in its place.

4. If you have a ready made switch, tape the other end of the new thread to one end of it. Then take the thread you removed from the battery and tape it to the other end of the switch. Now you can use the switch to turn the LED off and on.
    * Notice there is no positive or negative side on a switch

5.  If you don't have a switch, you can make one very easily. Take the two loose ends of thread in your circuit and hold them together to make your LED light up. When you separate them it turns off again. You have just created a simple switch! This is how all switches work.

<!-- basically connect the two ends of the conductive thread using any means -->
