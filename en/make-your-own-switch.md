1. What if you want to turn your circuit off? To do this you need a break somewhere in the connections. A _switch_ is a component that allows you to turn a circuit off and on easily.

2. There are lots of different types of switches - buttons, sliders, even magnetic or tilting ones. You can also make your own switch.![](/assets/switches_100_384_650.png)

3. On your circuit, separate the _positive_ hole of the battery holder from the thread. Take a new piece of thread and hold one end of the new piece onto the battery holder where the other thread was. You might need to team up with a third person here, for some extra hands! Otherwise you can always use tape, or use crocodile clips instead of thread.

4. If you have a ready made switch, hold the other end of the new thread to one end of it. Then take the thread you removed from the battery holder and hold it to the other end of the switch. Now you can use the switch to turn the LED off and on.
    * Notice there is no positive or negative side on a switch

5.  If you don't have a switch, you can make one very easily. Take the two loose ends of thread in your circuit and hold them together to make your LED light up. When you separate them it turns off again. You have just created a simple switch! This is how all switches work.![](/assets/switch_diy_thread_abc_120_650.png)


6. I've put tape near the end of each thread so you can more easily see where the "switch" is in the circuit.![](/assets/switch_diy_tape_a_120_650.png)
